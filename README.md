## Skills:
### Software Development:
I am a strong proponent of test-driven development (TDD) and have embraced as a core skill to my software development practice. While there are cons, such as a false sense of security, slower development time (in the short term) and high barrier of entry, I believe the benefits outweights the disadvantages. I'm committed to improving my TDD skills. Other skills I have acquired are object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, Agile methodologies, and a strong problem solving mindset. I'm looking for opportunities to put these skills to use and to further improve on them. 

### Soft skills: 
I believe that one of my core qualities is planning out my work and to anticipate different outcomes, whether it be ideas for artworks or creating lesson plans. However, my time teaching elementary and middle school students has also taught me that flexibility is also an important skill. You can plan as far ahead as you want but you have to be aware that you're working with other people as well and it doesn't always go to plan. I learnt that the hard way, you can imagine what it's like teaching teenagers. From that experience I have become more aware of the needs of others, whether they are in a more senior or junior position, and how to work collaboratively. My time at Makers has only reinforced that further through EI workshops, pair programming and constructive feedback. 
Being an artist has also taught me to be proactive and seek out new solutions to ideas. I've had to learn new skills like 3D modelling and large format photography through my own research. I believe this goes hand in hand with software development as a core skill is the ability to be independent in finding solutions to programming problems by reading through documentation and looking at past implementations.

## Hobbies & Other Interests
- **Art:** Had exhibitions in England, China, and Korea.
- **Sports:** Lifelong basketball player and former badminton trainee during my time in Korea.  
- **Games:** Fan of RPGs like Final Fantasy (since FF9) and Hideo Kojima’s games (Metal Gear Solid, Death Stranding). Recently started Resident Evil 2. Got into board games during COVID, now with a large collection. Most replayed: Catan. Latest additions: Ready, Set, Bet, Las Vegas, Coffee Rush. 
- **Languages:** Grew up bilingual (Cantonese, English) but never excelled in European languages. Learning Korean while living in Korea changed that—now fascinated by etymology and phonetics.  
- **Photography:** Passionate about analogue photography, camera history, and film. Currently curating a large-format photography book.
